      <h1>Scope of Practice for Nurse Practitioners</h1>
      <h2>Professional Role</h2>
      <p>
        Nurse practitioners (NPs) practice in nearly every health care setting,
        including clinics, hospitals, Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Care
        facilities, emergency rooms, urgent care sites, private physician or NP
        practices (both managed and owned by NPs), nursing homes, schools,
        colleges, retail clinics, public health departments, nurse-managed
        clinics, homeless clinics and home health. NP practice includes, but is
        not limited to, assessment; ordering, performing, supervising and
        interpreting diagnostic and laboratory tests; making diagnoses;
        initiating and managing treatment, including prescribing medication and
        non-pharmacologic treatments; coordinating care; counseling; and
        educating patients, their families and communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        As licensed, independent practitioners, NPs practice autonomously and in
        coordination with health care professionals and other individuals. NPs
        provide a wide range of health care services, including the diagnosis
        and management of acute, chronic and complex health problems; health
        promotion; disease prevention; health education; and counseling to
        individuals, families, groups and communities. They may also serve as
        health care researchers, interdisciplinary consultants and patient
        advocates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NP role is consistent with the APRN Consensus Model, practicing in
        the population foci of Family/Individual Across Lifespan, Pediatrics,
        Women’s Health/Gender Related, Adult-Gerontology, Neonatal and
        Psychiatric Mental Health. NP scope of practice is not setting-specific
        and is based on the needs of the patient.
      </p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        NPs are advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) who obtain graduate
        education at the masters, post-master’s or doctoral level and obtain
        national board certification. Academic NP programs follow established
        educational standards, which ensure the attainment of the APRN, role and
        population core competencies. Educational preparation provides NPs with
        specialized knowledge and clinical competency, which enable them to
        practice in various health care settings. National accreditation
        requirements for NP education programs and competency-based standards
        ensure NPs are equipped to provide safe, high-quality, cost-effective,
        patient-centered care upon graduation. Clinical practice competency and
        professional development are hallmarks of NP education.
      </p>

      <h2>Accountability</h2>
      <p>
        Each NP is accountable to patients, the nursing profession and their
        state board of nursing. NPs are expected to practice consistent with an
        ethical code of conduct, national certification, evidence-based
        principles and current practice standards.
      </p>
      <h2>Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        The patient-centered nature of the NP role requires a commitment to meet
        the evolving needs of society and advances in health care science. NPs
        are responsible to the public and adaptable to the dynamic changes in
        health care. As leaders in health care, NPs combine the roles of
        provider, mentor, educator, researcher, advocate and administrator. NPs
        take responsibility for their continued professional development,
        involvement in professional organizations and participation in health
        policy activities at the local, state, national and international
        levels. Five decades of research affirm that NPs provide safe,
        high-quality, cost-effective, patient-centered care.
