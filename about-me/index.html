      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Ann Bruer. I am a certified family nurse practitioner. I live
        in Kansas City, Missouri. I am originally from Springfield, Missouri.
        Before going to nursing school, I had a career in victim advocacy for
        approximately 15 years, mostly working in the intimate partner violence
        field. When I turned 40, I decided to change my career and started the
        long process of my journey. I took courses to become an EMT through the
        University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine in the evenings
        after work. Upon completing this certification, I started working at
        University Health, Lakewood Emergency Department as a patient care
        technician while I completed pre-requisite courses for nursing school.
        As I had already attained my Bachelors’ of Science from Missouri State
        University, I was able to apply to Research College of Nursing’s
        Accelerated Option Program. This enabled me to complete my Bachelors’ of
        Science in Nursing in one short (but busy) year. As a single mother of
        two adolescents during this time, I was driven to succeed not only for
        myself but for my children. I completed my Bachelors’ of Science in
        Nursing in 2019. Afterwards, I immediately applied for, and was accepted
        into, the Research College of Nursing Master’s Program for Family Nurse
        Practitioners. While attending school, I began working at North Kanas
        City Hospital in the Float Pool. While I love working in the emergency
        department, I felt like this opportunity would broaden my knowledge in
        healthcare. I have worked with orthopedic, oncology, rehabilitation,
        telemetry, and neurology patients. This experience definitely expanded
        my understanding of chronic health conditions as well as ways in which
        to treat them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe I have a unique understanding of patient care, as I am a
        congenital heart defect patient. I was born with Transposition of the
        Great Arteries and have received three open heart surgeries (all before
        age three). I am a patient at a local cardiology office and see my
        cardiologist at least once a year. As one of the first patients to
        receive a surgical procedure that saved my life as an infant, my future
        cardiac health is somewhat of a mystery. As a result, I can emphasize
        with patients in the “unknowing” of their personal health care
        throughout their lifetimes. In addition, during my Bachelors’ of Science
        in Nursing Program, my fiancé was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer as
        a result of being exposed to burn pits during his station in
        Afghanistan. Consequently, I have learned that life can hand you
        challenges that quickly changes one’s perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am now married to my husband and he is doing well. I have two
        children, Hannah and Charlie as well as two step daughters, Sierra and
        Averi. I am also a step grandmother to Jameison and Liam. Finally, I
        have three dogs, Miller, Laila, and Chico. I enjoy spending time with my
        family (including the dogs), traveling, and watching anything that is
        true crime documentaries.
