      <h1>Philosophy</h1>
      <p>
        As a family nurse practitioner (FNP), I am grounded in the values and
        principles of nursing, as well as the unique role and responsibilities
        of the NP. The emphasis of patient-centered care, holistic assessment
        and treatment, as well as advocating for my patients is at the core of
        practice. Finally, collaboration with other professional safeguards
        against missed opportunities for successful healthcare outcomes. I am
        devoted to working with other for the benefit of my patients.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am committed to providing patient-centered care. Prioritizing each
        patientâ€™s individual needs, desires, and values in regards to their care
        is paramount when making collaborative healthcare decisions. This is
        crucial to developing and building trust in my relationship with
        patients as well as ensuring they are involved in the direction of their
        own healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a holistic standpoint, I am steadfast in understanding that not
        only physical symptoms, but emotional, social, and spiritual well-being
        are imperative when considering patient health. I believe that
        healthcare is not only focused on treating illness or disease, but
        overall health. Additionally, health promotion and disease prevention
        are at the forefront of my practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a previous advocate to women in crisis, I have learned the benefit of
        advocacy. Advocacy is a key component in my FNP philosophy. I will
        remain dedicated to advocating for patients, as well as ensuring the
        received the best possible care. This is inclusive of healthcare
        services as well as for their rights and personal healthcare preferences
        and decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, collaboration with other healthcare professionals is essential
        in my practice. Working alongside other healthcare professionals, in
        addition to the patients and their families, expands the possibilities
        for positive healthcare outcomes. A comprehensive healthcare plan is
        critical within patient care. I understand the best possible outcomes
        are only achieved by inclusion, collaboration, and a team approach for
        all patients.
      </p>
      <p>
        By staying grounded in the principles of nursing as well as underscoring
        the importance of patient-centered, holistic, advocacy-based and
        collaborative care. I strive to be an effective, well-rounded,
        accepting, and strong advocate for patients as they navigate through
        their lifelong healthcare.
